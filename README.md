# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 2. Version Differences
#### 1.	Main Menu
In *the first* design, i changed "Ngladeni" button to "Layanan" button. I think that's the appropriate name to represents other services menu. For *the second* design, i try to add "Deals & Promo" feature with horizontal scroll. The user should do a swipe left on "Deals & Promo" to see more promos. On *the last* one, i remove the advertisement section and keep the "Deals & Promo" section on the bottom of the page.

#### 2. Belonjo Page
I remove the "Rekomendasi Merchant" button on the bottom of the page for *the first* design. On *the second* design, i remove the advertisement carrousel, placed the "Rekomendasi" (Shows recommended merchant) feature under application bar. This feature navigate by a horizontal scroll. And then i placed a tab bar after the "Rekomendasi" feature. There are 4 tabs "Semua" (Shows all available merchants), "Terbaik" (Shows all merchants with good ratings), "Terdekat" (Shows all near me merchants), "Terbaru" (Shows all newcomers merchants). To move from one to another tab, user should swipe the screen to left/right or tap on the tab name. All merchants in each tab shown as a list. I also changed the search widget into a search button on the right corner of the page. For *the third* one, i make a simpler design with the search widget under application bar and built all merchants filter as a display menu. I also put "Rekomendasi" feature on the bottom of the page.

#### 3. Alert for not available service
On *the first* design, i only put a message text right after the search widget for notifying that the service is not available. For *the second* design, there's a pop up message contains warning symbol and text. The pop up will be disappeared after a few seconds. For *the last* one, the alert will be shown as a pop up message that contains symbol, text, and a button. The pop up message will be disappeared after the user tap on this button.

#### 4. Package Lists
In *the first* design, all packages listed on one page. Each item contains images, short description, and price.
For *the second* design, all packages filtered with tab bar under the application bar. 
*The third* design, provide the list of packages in a grid view and filtered with tab bar.

#### 5. Package Details
After users press "Lanjutkan Pemesanan" button on the package lists page, users will be directed to package list and ordering form.
On package details, *the first* design shows the details of package in a page. The page contains a carrousel images and text area for description and details for the package. Given a button which can be pressed to continue the ordering process. *The second* design shows a step bar with carrousel images and details for package wrapped as an expanded list. On *the last* one, the details of the package will be appeared as a modal(pop up modal) when users tapped on the button.

#### 6. Order Form
The last step to order a service is filling the ordering form. *The first* design shows a plain form for ordering data. The date and time shown as a text input in the separate field. While in *the second* design, there is a progress bar and date time shown as clock icons with the clockwise that shown the event time. *The third* design shown date and time input as a text. There are no separated date and time input. Users must press the "Selesaikan Pemesanan" button to finish the order.

### 3. Selected Sketch
Here are several things that we have to concerned about for the next step on part B and C:
* I would like to choose the third design for main menu. I think this is the simplest one. It contains no advertisements. I think that's not true if we put advertisements on the application that offers products/service. It might be annoy users. Moreover, the user might not be noticed on our offering products/services.
* For the "Belonjo" page, i prefer to choose the third one, because i like the way it filtered all merchants. We have more filters in it and there's also a search bar which can be used for searching a name of merchants quickly. This is a simple design which has an easy-to-understand menu.
* For alert design, i would like to choose the third design because it shows the message clearly. In addition, it has a button redirecting to the original page. I would rather to choose this pop up message than the second one, it will make users sure that the feature is not available yet.
* For package lists design, i choose the second one. The tab bar will be filtering all packages as it stated. The packages will shown as a column list, it will be easier to see the packages as a column lists rather than a grid view.
* For package details, i think it would be best if we choose the second design. Because it wrapped the details of package to an expanded list. We only need a click to see the details for package, users will give more focus on the explained details.  
* For ordering form, i choose the first design because separating date and time will help users to input the data correctly. We can add the step bar on top of the page, it depends on the chosen package details layout.

### 4. Design Rationale

There are several do and dont's that i suggested in the contextual inquiry. I adapt those suggestions on my proposed design. I make an alert design because there are no alert or information in the application if the service is not available. I changed the word "Ngladeni" into "Layanan", because "Ngladeni" seems like a strange word to represents "other services" menu. When i'm on contextual inquiry process, my target user clicked on the "Rekomendasi Merchant" and it directed to whatsapp message for contacting the application holder (The apps asks user to give suggestion about their recommended merchants). That's make users get confused, because they're might be mistaken because the name of the button. Thus, i deleted the "Rekomendasi Merchant" button and make a new layout design. Previously, the ordering form give no information on every offered packages. They provide an image, but users can't open that image or tap on the image. Then, i try to make a new ordering process layout for this application. I separated the offering package information and the order details itself. We have more steps to finish the order, but this is satisfying and bring the order information clearly.
